how to setup:
1. extract the zip file in your plugins folder, do NOT rename the folder as that will break the mod.
2. When you open the extracted folder you will see two .txt files called `"webhookURL.txt"` and `"yourname.txt"`.  open the `"webhookURL.txt"` file and replace the text that says "YOURWEBHOOKURL", with your webhook url. Once your done with that open the `"yourname.txt"` and replace the text that says "YOURNAME", with your name
3. once you're done with that you should be done!
